## **Acknowledgments**

### **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THE THIRD EDITION**

**I** thank the readers of the first two editions of this book for giving it such a kind and enthusiastic reception, for taking its ideas to heart, and for letting me know what a positive influence it had on them and their work. I thank the many professors who used the book in their courses, and the many engineering teams that adopted it.

I thank the whole team at Addison-Wesley and Pearson for their kindness, professionalism, patience, and grace under extreme pressure. Through it all, my editor Greg Doench remained unflappable: a fine editor and a perfect gentleman. I’m afraid his hair may have turned a bit gray as a result of this project, and I humbly apologize. My project manager, Julie Nahil, and my project editor, Dana Wilson, were all I could hope for: diligent, prompt, organized, and friendly. My copy editor, Kim Wimpsett, was meticulous and tasteful.

I have yet again been blessed with the best team of reviewers imaginable, and I give my sincerest thanks to each of them. The core team, who reviewed most every chapter, consisted of Cindy Bloch, Brian Kernighan, Kevin Bourrillion, Joe Bowbeer, William Chargin, Joe Darcy, Brian Goetz, Tim Halloran, Stuart Marks, Tim Peierls, and Yoshiki Shibata. Other reviewers included Marcus Biel, Dan Bloch, Beth Bottos, Martin Buchholz, Michael Diamond, Charlie Garrod, Tom Hawtin, Doug Lea, Aleksey Shipilëv, Lou Wasserman, and Peter Weinberger. These reviewers made numerous suggestions that led to great improvements in this book and saved me from many embarrassments.

I give special thanks to William Chargin, Doug Lea, and Tim Peierls, who served as sounding boards for many of the ideas in this book. William, Doug, and Tim were unfailingly generous with their time and knowledge.

Finally, I thank my wife, Cindy Bloch, for encouraging me to write, for reading each item in raw form, for writing the index, for helping me with all of the things that invariably come up when you take on a big project, and for putting up with me while I wrote.

### **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THE FIRST EDITION**

I thank Patrick Chan for suggesting that I write this book and for pitching the idea to Lisa Friendly, the series managing editor; Tim Lindholm, the series technical editor; and Mike Hendrickson, executive editor of Addison-Wesley. I thank Lisa, Tim, and Mike for encouraging me to pursue the project and for their superhuman patience and unyielding faith that I would someday write this book.

I thank James Gosling and his original team for giving me something great to write about, and I thank the many Java platform engineers who followed in James’s footsteps. In particular, I thank my colleagues in Sun’s Java Platform Tools and Libraries Group for their insights, their encouragement, and their support. The team consists of Andrew Bennett, Joe Darcy, Neal Gafter, Iris Garcia, Konstantin Kladko, Ian Little, Mike McCloskey, and Mark Reinhold. Former members include Zhenghua Li, Bill Maddox, and Naveen Sanjeeva.

I thank my manager, Andrew Bennett, and my director, Larry Abrahams, for lending their full and enthusiastic support to this project. I thank Rich Green, the VP of Engineering at Java Software, for providing an environment where engineers are free to think creatively and to publish their work.
